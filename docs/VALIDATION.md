# Movie-catalog milestone validation — 2026-10-22

Implemented: single-admin authentication, encrypted TMDb configuration, real
TMDb movie search/details, canonical idempotent movie adds, and a paginated
movie library. This completes the requested catalog milestone; the full
Torznab/download/import vertical slice remains on the roadmap.

## Local checks passed

| Check | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Go tests | `go test ./...`: auth, config, database, HTTP, library, metadata, securestore and settings |
| Static Go checks | `go vet ./...` |
| Authentication | Protected API data, one-time setup closure, invalid credentials, Argon2id hashes, hashed session storage, cookie flags, session expiry/restart/logout, rate/concurrency limits, password recovery revocation |
| Credentials | AES-GCM encryption, reopen with matching key, reject missing key/tampered ciphertext, write-only status responses, failed replacement preserves current token |
| Provider contract | Bearer header, encoded query/page/adult flag, details normalization, official poster URLs, error/body limits, rate-limit cooldown, timeouts and safe errors |
| Movie workflow | Authenticated provider configure → search → canonical details → add → library read; duplicate retry survives provider failure without changing monitoring |
| Library | Concurrent duplicate adds create one row; 24-item pagination/totals; metadata, monitoring and artwork references survive reopen |
| SQLite | Initial creation and existing migration history, WAL/foreign keys/timeouts, rollback, checksum drift/newer schema rejection, Unicode config paths |
| Frontend | TypeScript check, formatting check, production Vite build |
| UI behavior | 11 tests: setup/login, session expiry/logout, search/details/add with monitoring choice, failed add, write-only TMDb save, settings/conflicts/offline recovery/navigation |
| Dependency repair | Fresh npm install from repaired lock; Linux x64 dry-run resolution succeeds; npm reports zero known vulnerabilities at install time |
| Native executable | Windows amd64 build and real process launch |
| Native process smoke | Embedded frontend/assets, health/readiness, protected API, setup-code CLI, setup/login, session + settings across restart, healthcheck CLI, stdin password reset/revocation and logout |
| Browser | Narrow-viewport administrator setup page renders with labels and code instructions; actual account creation left to the owner |

Local tools: Windows amd64, portable Go 1.27.3, Node 24.12.0, npm 11.6.2.
Tests use temporary config roots only. Provider response fixtures exist only
inside tests; production always uses the real official TMDb HTTPS adapter.
No existing user media was scanned or changed.

## CI and environment limits

The foundation push's [first CI run](https://github.com/faaaaq/ReelScarey/actions/runs/39851298503)
failed before tests: npm found missing cross-platform @emnapi dependency entries.
This milestone regenerates the lock without an existing node_modules directory
and verifies both a clean Windows install and Linux resolution.

The updated workflow runs the full frontend suite, Go race detector/static
checks, native authenticated smoke test, Docker build and authenticated
container restart/persistence/health/FFprobe smoke test. Container and Linux
race execution require CI because Docker and a C toolchain are not available
locally. Results will be recorded after that workflow runs on this branch.

## Remaining acceptance work

- Live authenticated TMDb search/add requires the owner's Read Access Token
  entered in Settings. It has not been supplied or substituted with demo data.
- Linux/ARM deployment coverage, resource measurements, backup/restore drills,
  broad accessibility audits and full security review remain future work.
- No indexer, downloader, import worker, TV ingest or subtitle adapter exists yet.
- Sessions use a fixed 24-hour lifetime. Rate-limit counters are memory-resident
  and reset on restart; durable sessions and library data are SQLite-backed.
- The project license still needs the owner's choice before public distribution.

## Reproduce

Follow README.md to build the UI before Go, then run `go test ./...`,
`go vet ./...` and `node scripts/smoke.mjs <binary-path>`. The smoke test creates
and removes only its own temporary config directory. `scripts/container-smoke.mjs`
is intended exclusively for the disposable `reelscarey-ci` container in CI.
See AUTHENTICATION.md for first setup, password recovery and key backup.
