# Validation record — 2026-10-22

## Movie download/import milestone

Implemented Torznab capability tests/search, authenticated qBittorrent submission,
encrypted settings and torrent payloads, durable leased reconciliation, file
selection and FFprobe/SHA-256 verified imports. All media tests use temporary
roots and generated data; no existing user library or torrents are modified.

- Local Go suite and API/security checks pass, including lost-response recovery,
  lease fencing, traversal, collision refusal, staged-copy restart and already-
  published restart. Windows uses staged copies; Linux anchored links and actual
  cross-filesystem behavior are exercised in CI.
- Real local FFmpeg/FFprobe generated a video, verified it, and rejected garbage.
- Frontend formatting, TypeScript, production build and 17 behavior tests pass.
- Windows executable build and isolated native startup/auth/restart smoke pass.
- Linux CI includes an opt-in real authenticated qBittorrent-nox test with a
  private generated video downloaded from a localhost web seed. Its Torznab
  service is a protocol fixture, not a public indexer. CI results are recorded
  after execution.
- The owner's hosted qBittorrent connection was verified and saved through
  Settings after supporting its newer HTTP 204 login and session-cookie format.
  Credentials were entered privately and remain encrypted. No owner torrents
  were added or changed. No Torznab service is configured yet; an indexer and a
  shared download mount remain necessary for owner-service acceptance.

See [workflow operations](MOVIE_WORKFLOW.md) for filesystem guarantees and limits.

## Previous movie-catalog milestone

Implemented: single-admin authentication, encrypted TMDb configuration, real
TMDb movie search/details, canonical idempotent movie adds, and a paginated
movie library. This completes the requested catalog milestone; the full
Torznab/download/import vertical slice remains on the roadmap.

## Local checks passed

| Check | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Go tests | `go test ./...`: auth, config, database, HTTP, library, metadata, securestore and settings |
| Static Go checks | `go vet ./...` |
| Authentication | Protected API data, one-time setup closure, invalid credentials, Argon2id hashes, hashed session storage, cookie flags, session expiry/restart/logout, rate/concurrency limits, password recovery revocation |
| Credentials | AES-GCM encryption, reopen with matching key, reject missing key/tampered ciphertext, write-only status responses, failed replacement preserves current token |
| Provider contract | Bearer header, encoded query/page/adult flag, details normalization, official poster URLs, error/body limits, rate-limit cooldown, timeouts and safe errors |
| Movie workflow | Authenticated provider configure → search → canonical details → add → library read; duplicate retry survives provider failure without changing monitoring |
| Library | Concurrent duplicate adds create one row; 24-item pagination/totals; metadata, monitoring and artwork references survive reopen |
| SQLite | Initial creation and existing migration history, WAL/foreign keys/timeouts, rollback, checksum drift/newer schema rejection, Unicode config paths |
| Frontend | TypeScript check, formatting check, production Vite build |
| UI behavior | 12 tests: setup/login, truncated setup-code feedback before an API attempt, session expiry/logout, search/details/add with monitoring choice, failed add, write-only TMDb save, settings/conflicts/offline recovery/navigation |
| Dependency repair | Fresh npm install from repaired lock; Linux x64 dry-run resolution succeeds; npm reports zero known vulnerabilities at install time |
| Native executable | Windows amd64 build and real process launch |
| Native process smoke | Embedded frontend/assets, health/readiness, protected API, setup-code CLI, setup/login, session + settings across restart, healthcheck CLI, stdin password reset/revocation and logout |
| Browser | Owner created the administrator and entered the TMDb token privately in Settings; connection verified and saved. Live search and details returned Mutiny (2026), TMDb 1288445, 96 minutes. Adding it saved one monitored library entry with its poster and synopsis, visibly marked Not downloaded. The session and saved movie remained after replacing and restarting the preview executable, and Test saved connection verified the encrypted token after restart. |

Local tools: Windows amd64, portable Go 1.27.3, Node 24.12.0, npm 11.6.2.
Tests use temporary config roots only. Provider response fixtures exist only
inside tests; production always uses the real official TMDb HTTPS adapter.
No existing user media was scanned or changed.

## CI and environment limits

The foundation push's [first CI run](https://github.com/faaaaq/ReelScarey/actions/runs/39851298503)
failed before tests: npm found missing cross-platform @emnapi dependency entries.
This milestone regenerates the lock without an existing node_modules directory
and verifies both a clean Windows install and Linux resolution.

The milestone's first Docker build found an existing /media directory in the
Debian runtime image. Changing directory creation to mkdir -p fixed the build.
The [successful Linux run](https://github.com/faaaaq/ReelScarey/actions/runs/39881583988)
at commit 45d3983 passed the full frontend suite, Go race detector/static checks,
native authenticated smoke test, Docker build and authenticated container
restart/persistence/health/FFprobe smoke test. The subsequent setup-code UX fix
adds a twelfth frontend test, which passes locally. Docker and a C toolchain are
not available locally, so container and race checks run in GitHub Actions.

## Remaining acceptance work

- Linux/ARM deployment coverage, resource measurements, backup/restore drills,
  broad accessibility audits and full security review remain future work.
- Owner-service download/import acceptance requires the indexer and shared mount
  described above. TV ingest and subtitle adapters remain future work.
- Sessions use a fixed 24-hour lifetime. Rate-limit counters are memory-resident
  and reset on restart; durable sessions and library data are SQLite-backed.
- The project license still needs the owner's choice before public distribution.

## Reproduce

Follow README.md to build the UI before Go, then run `go test ./...`,
`go vet ./...` and `node scripts/smoke.mjs <binary-path>`. The smoke test creates
and removes only its own temporary config directory. `scripts/container-smoke.mjs`
is intended exclusively for the disposable `reelscarey-ci` container in CI.
See AUTHENTICATION.md for first setup, password recovery and key backup.
